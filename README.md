# CS4500-Projects
Projects from Professor Matthias Felleisen's [Spring 2016 Software Development class] (http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/4500-s16/index.html). Project descriptions are detailed in the Projects' Specifics page.

Directories 1 through 4 are progressive implementations of the [6Nimmit! game] (http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/4500-s16/take5.html), while directories 5 through 14 are implementations of the [Evolution game] (http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/4500-s16/evolution.html). Each directory contains a specific README detailing the goal of the project, the executables, and how to read/run the files. Directory 14 contains the final implementation of Evolution, which is playable locally or remotely against AI. The preceding directories are included to display a history of incremental improvement of the game.

The first six projects were collaborative with [Austin Colcord] (https://github.com/ajdcolcord), and the last eight with [Jake Campolo] (https://github.com/campoloj).
